# Compiler-Design-Programs
Here's a list of helpful compiler design programs that I've done. The programs may look big and scary when you first look at it but it's easy to understand if you pay attention for sometime.
Simply copy and paste the programs onto your CPP IDE and enjoy the programs.
# NOTE: 1) Here parser.c is LR-ZERO PARSER. 2) lrec.cpp is the program to remove Left Recursion. 
# Happy Coding!
